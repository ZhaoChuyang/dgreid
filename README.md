# Strong Baseline for Domain Generalizable Person Re-identification (DG-ReID)

This repository implements several commonly used methods in domain generalization and domain generalizable person re-identification tasks. Based on our implementation, we can achieve state-of-the-art result on large-scale DG-ReID benchmarks. Part of the code is based on [IDM](https://github.com/SikaStar/IDM).

## Implemented methods

- Meta-learning Domain Generalization (MLDG)
- Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN)
- Representation Self-Challenging (RSC)
- Self-supervised Contrastive Regularization (SelfReg)

- CUHKSYSU
- DukeMTMC
- GRID
- ILIDS
- Market1501
