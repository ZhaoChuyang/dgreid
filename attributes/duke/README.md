# DukeMTMC-attribute

## About dataset

We annotate 23 attributes for [DukeMTMC-reID](https://github.com/layumi/DukeMTMC-reID_evaluation), 
which  is a subset of the [DukeMTMC](http://vision.cs.duke.edu/DukeMTMC/). 
The original dataset contains 702 identities for training and 1110 identities for testing. 
The attributes are annotated in the identity level, thus the file contains 24 x 702 attributes for training and 24 x 1110 for test, where the label "image_index" denotes the identity. 
The annotations are contained in the file duke_attribute.mat.


The 23 attributes are: 

| attribute | representation in file | label |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| gender | gender | male(1), female(2) |
| length of upper-body clothing | top | short upper body clothing(1), long(2)    |
| wearing boots| boots| no(1), yes(2)    |
| wearing hat| hat | no(1), yes(2) |
| carrying backpack| backpack | no(1), yes(2) |
| carrying bag| bag | no(1), yes(2) |
| carrying handbag| handbag | no(1), yes(2) |
| color of shoes| shoes | dark(1), light(2) |
| 8 color of upper-body clothing| upblack, upwhite, upred, uppurple, upgray, upblue, upgreen, upbrown | no(1), yes(2) |
| 7 color of lower-body clothing| downblack, downwhite, downred, downgray, downblue, downgreen, downbrown | no(1), yes(2) |

Note that the though there are 7 and 8 attributes for lower-body clothing and upper-body clothing, only one color is labeled as yes (2) for an identity.
